## About My Career

In my professional life I have been active as an engineer and entrepreneur. I've been formally trained as a mechanical engineer with a focus on robotics at the Eindhoven University of Technology. In parallel I've been exploring AI techniques since roughly 2018, starting with a research internship at Tech United, and then expanding by founding AI student team Serpentine. I managed to combine both skills in a role as AI engineer at VBTI working on robotics in the agriculture sector after graduation. Now I work as an independent AI engineering contractor.
