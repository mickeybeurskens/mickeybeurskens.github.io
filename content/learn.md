## Game Development

### Online

- __[Develop.Games](https://develop.games/)__: Comprehensive, non BS guide to get you started on your game development journey by the awesome Thor of Pirate Software. Includes everything from tips to tools.

### Tools

- __[Godot](https://godotengine.org/)__: Free and open source game engine, great for starting out! I have mainly used it for 2D games. Is cross-platform, so also works for UI related projects.
- __[Blender](https://www.blender.org/)__: Free and open source 3D modelling software. You can design, rig, animate and texture all kinds of models. One of my personal favorite open source projects and unbelievably powerful.

## Fiction

### Books

- __[Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](https://hpmor.com/)__ by _Eliezer Yudkowsky_ - You will either _really_ like this or totally not care. Closest thing to an info hazard on this page probably. It is also _very long_. As far as content goes, wikipedia summarizes it nicely: 

>  It adapts the story of Harry Potter to explain complex concepts in cognitive science, philosophy, and the scientific method. [The book] supposes that Harry's aunt Petunia Evans married an Oxford professor and homeschooled Harry in science and rational thinking, allowing Harry to enter the magical world with ideals from the Age of Enlightenment and an experimental spirit. The fan fiction spans one year, covering Harry's first year in Hogwarts.
