Welcome, dear reader.

On this website I write about topics that I care about.

Born and raised a Dutchman, [I work as an entrepreneur and artificial intelligence engineer](https://www.forgefire.dev) at my own company. There I spend my time figuring out if AI can solve a certain problems, do research, build prototypes and generally expand my knowledge on the subject.

I also tend to think a lot about AI and its impact on society. Building safe AI is insanely difficuly, and so we will face some major challenges in the coming years. I try to get a grip on the major problems that we might face in the long term, what we might do to mitigate the risks and how we might expose the opportunities.

My content is mostly meant to be accessible to everyone, but once in a while I write very technical posts. I will try to make it clear which one is which so you can pick and choose what to read.

Although the pas years my focus has been on AI, I intend to write about other topics as I see fit.

I hope you will enjoy the your stay. Thank you for reading my work.
