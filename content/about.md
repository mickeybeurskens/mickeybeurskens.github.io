Welcome, dear reader




Born and raised a Dutchman, [I work as an independent contractor in artificial intelligence engineering](https://www.forgefire.dev). My aim with this website is to share what I know, organize my thoughts and inspire you to start hacking your own projects along the way.

As far as Artificial Intelligence is concerned I would like to see a world where every person owns their own. It should run on your own device so they are maximally aligned with the people using them, not the organizations that build them. You should feel like the AI is helping you, not replacing you. 

I'd also much prefer local custom tailored AI-daimons to summoning a big super-intelligent AI demon. The former seems like the kind of techno-wizardry I'd like most people to have access to.

I write about all kinds of topics here, depending on my interest of the day and what I consider useful to know. Such is the joy of running your own website. Go and build your own if you haven't!

Thank you for stopping by.
