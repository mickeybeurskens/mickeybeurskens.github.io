Welcome, dear reader.

On this website I write about topics that I care about.

Born and raised a Dutchman, I [work as an entrepreneur and artificial intelligence engineer](https://www.forgefire.dev). Usually I spend my time figuring out if AI can solve a certain problems, do research, build prototypes and generally expand my knowledge on the subject.

Given my background in robotics and my work I tend to think a lot about AI. I try to get a grip on the major problems that we might face in the long term, and what we might to mitigate the challenges and risks.

Mostly I try to write content that is accessible to everyone, but once in a while I write very technical posts. I will try to make it clear which one is which so you can pick and choose what to read.

Other times I just write about anything that catches my attention. You might find writing on design, video games, music, finance or psychology.

I hope you will enjoy the journey. Thank you for reading my work.
