I am a Dutch PhD student researching Safe Artificial Intelligence at Eindhoven University of Technology. My work focuses on responsible AI development, specifically on reinforcement learning systems dealing with uncertainty, an area I consider largely unsolved.

Occasionally I work as an independent contractor and regularly contribute to open source projects. I enjoy exploring new concepts in AI and computing, sharing my insights through this website.

I mainly write about AI and technology, although I also use this place for other creative pursuits. 

Thank you for reading, enjoy.
