Welcome, dear reader.

Born and raised a Dutchman, [I work as a freelance artificial intelligence engineer](https://www.forgefire.dev). I spend my time figuring out how AI can be used to solve problems, doing research, building prototypes and generally expanding my knowledge on AI and computers.

I also tend to think a lot about AI and its impact on society. Building safe AI is insanely difficuly. I try to get a grip on the problems that we might face in the long term, what we might do to mitigate the risks and how we might expose the opportunities.

Although my focus has been on AI for the past couple of years, I write about other topics too.

I hope you will enjoy your stay. Thank you for reading my work.
